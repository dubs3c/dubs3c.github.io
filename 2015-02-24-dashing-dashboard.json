The software we decided to use was <a href=\"http://dashing.io\">Dashing.io</a>. Dashing is a Sinatra based framework written in ruby that lets you build beautiful dashboards.</p>\n<p>I had no previous experience with ruby but it went well, as it was mostly syntax that differed from what I was used to.</p>\n<p>Developing the API on our backend system and sending the data to Dashing in JSON format was a breeze. Fun little project.</p>\n<p>We needed people to be able so sign in as well, to view the dashboard from outside the office. I connected it to our mysql database so users could sign in.</p>\n<p>There's a lot of customization you can do with Dashing if you dive into it, I really recommend it.</p>"}
