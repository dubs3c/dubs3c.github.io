My name is Michael and I'm currently working as a security consultant. Studied Computer Systems and Networks for my Master's degree at Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden. Before Chalmers I was working for an e-commerce company doing a little bit of everything, mainly it-support, PHP development, system administration and business intelligence. 

During my free time I enjoy playing CTF/[HTB](https://www.hackthebox.eu/profile/6077), develop new tools/software and learning new cool technologies.
