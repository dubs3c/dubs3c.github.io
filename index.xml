Rust code always looked messy and so different from what I am used to. But since I started learning Rust, I have begun to enjoy the language. However, one thing that has been more difficult than what I have imagined it to be, is error handling.
For example, in Go it is normal to return Error and simply set it nil if there is no error.</description></item><item><title>Hacking the Success Code: 6 Habits Every Penetration Tester Must Have</title><link>https://dubell.io/hacking-the-success-code-6-habits-every-penetration-tester-must-have/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Oct 2023 14:51:17 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://dubell.io/hacking-the-success-code-6-habits-every-penetration-tester-must-have/</guid><description>After have working professionally in cyber security as a penetration tester for half a decade (hacking scene for 10+), I feel I have learned a few things on how to improve your skill set, way of working and communicating with customers. I have also had the opportunity to work with some great people in cyber security from which I have learned considerably from.
In this article, I will present six habits which I believe represent a strong penetration tester.</description></item><item><title>Supercharge Your Integration Tests with the Power of Docker</title><link>https://dubell.io/supercharge-your-integration-tests-with-the-power-of-docker/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Sep 2023 12:25:17 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://dubell.io/supercharge-your-integration-tests-with-the-power-of-docker/</guid><description>In the beginning of my developer career, I learned to use in-memory databases for running integration tests. The in-memory database made it easy to spin up a local database which is often needed for integration testing. However, there are some drawbacks with this approach.
A Clever Illusion Using an in-memory database does not reflect the real database running in production. The local database may look and feel like the real deal, but it&amp;rsquo;s essentially an illusion, and a clever one.</description></item><item><title>Learn AI or Get Left Behind</title><link>https://dubell.io/learn-ai-or-get-left-behind/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Sep 2023 12:25:17 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://dubell.io/learn-ai-or-get-left-behind/</guid><description>The AI boom has not gone unnoticed, ChatGPT captured everyone&amp;rsquo;s attention with its science fiction like behavior, and the generative image AIs have gone super nova, disrupting everything we knew about art.
We have not yet figured out what all this means for the future. One thing is clear though, if you want to be apart of the future, you&amp;rsquo;re going to need to learn AI.

If you want to, you can checkout one of my Django applications here, where I have implemented the steps described in this article. The main idea is that every time you create a &amp;ldquo;release&amp;rdquo;, Github will pick up newest release version and trigger a docker build for that release. The end result is quite amazing, because now you can simply run docker pull ghcr.</description></item><item><title>Should you take a black box approach or a white box approach in penetration testing?</title><link>https://dubell.io/should-you-take-a-black-box-approach-or-a-white-box-approach-in-penetration-testing/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Nov 2022 12:25:17 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://dubell.io/should-you-take-a-black-box-approach-or-a-white-box-approach-in-penetration-testing/</guid><description>Lately, customers have been asking for a black box approach when performing a penetration test of their system/web application. During meetings, it has been clear to me that the stakeholders do not fully understand the differences between a white box and a black box approach and what benefits they provide. Therefore I would like to write down some of my thoughts on the subject, perhaps it will give an additional perspective when choosing between these approaches.</description></item><item><title>Measuring attack paths in web applications</title><link>https://dubell.io/measuring-attack-paths-in-web-applications/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Oct 2022 14:51:17 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://dubell.io/measuring-attack-paths-in-web-applications/</guid><description>Recently a customer asked us after our penetration test against their web application, the percentage of possible attack paths we had covered. It was a difficult question to answer because, a) the customer wanted us to focus on SQL injection and XSS (long story why) and b) it was a legacy application from 2003 containing a lot of code. The short answer I gave was that since the test was focused towards SQLi and XSS, naturally, some attack paths were not considered.</description></item><item><title>My thoughts on Secure Code Review</title><link>https://dubell.io/my-thoughts-on-secure-code-review/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jul 2022 09:51:17 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://dubell.io/my-thoughts-on-secure-code-review/</guid><description>In this article I would like to share my thoughts, methodologies and techniques on how I perform secure code review. By secure I mean code review with the purpose of finding unknown vulnerabilities. My focus is generally on web applications, but the ideas mentioned below apply to other types of software as well.
1. Understanding üë®‚Äçüè´ Begin by understanding the application. Browse through the code and the application&amp;rsquo;s functionality until you have a clear intuition for what the application is capable of.</description></item><item><title>Python gems to look out for</title><link>https://dubell.io/python-gems-to-look-out-for/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dubell.io/python-gems-to-look-out-for/</guid><description>A few weeks ago I was looking into Python specific code patterns that would lead to vulnerabilities. I was surprised when I found a few patterns that I hadn&amp;rsquo;t really thought about, most likely because I never write Python code like the examples I found. Nevertheless, I learned something new and thought I share it here.
Example One Passing an untrusted string to an f-string while passing a dict as an argument to the logger, may give the attacker the possibility to read keys in the dict that should not be readable.</description></item><item><title>Unauthenticated LFI in Appwrite 0.5.0 &lt;= 0.12.1</title><link>https://dubell.io/unauthenticated-lfi-in-appwrite-0.5.0-0.12.1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Feb 2022 13:13:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dubell.io/unauthenticated-lfi-in-appwrite-0.5.0-0.12.1/</guid><description>While exploring cyber space I stumbled upon a project called Appwrite. Looked interesting, started browsing the code. Eventually, I discovered an undisclosed vulnerability in one of the endpoints allowing an attacker to read local files on the system.
The endpoint /.well-known/acme-challenge is vulnerable against local file inclusion which allows an attacker to read arbitrary files on the system. The endpoint contains incorrect checks for verifying that file is located within a defined base path.</description></item><item><title>Overwriting HttpOnly cookies with Javascript</title><link>https://dubell.io/overwriting-httponly-cookies-with-javascript/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Nov 2021 13:13:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dubell.io/overwriting-httponly-cookies-with-javascript/</guid><description>So I got in contact with Sam Anttila on twitter regarding his article about overwriting HttpOnly enabled cookies using Javascript, which should not be possible. I asked him if he had verified if Firefox exhibits the same behavior. He answered yes and the result was negative, but the test was done a long time ago and things could have changed.

It was built with Python2.7 and was heavily obfuscated. I decided to analyse it and try to break it apart to understand it better and its capabilities.
In this article, I will show some parts of the malware and explain its purpose. I will also provide some detection techniques for detecting this specific malware.</description></item><item><title>SLAE 7: Creating your own crypter using golang</title><link>https://dubell.io/slae-7-creating-your-own-crypter-using-golang/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jan 2020 13:33:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dubell.io/slae-7-creating-your-own-crypter-using-golang/</guid><description>In this article, we will build a simple crypter for encrypting and decrypting shellcode. I chose to implement the crypter in Go using environmental keys.
I will not spend time implementing a fancy shellcode execution method in this article, only encryption and decryption methods are in scope for now.
Encryption The encryption/decryption process is using AES GCM and a specific file in /etc/ concatenated with the current user logged in as the key.</description></item><item><title>SLAE 6: Creating polymorphic shellcode</title><link>https://dubell.io/slae-6-creating-polymorphic-shellcode/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jan 2020 13:33:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dubell.io/slae-6-creating-polymorphic-shellcode/</guid><description>The goal of this article is to create polymorphic verions of three different shellcodes from http://shell-storm.org. Polymorphic shellcode has the ability to mutate its code everytime it runs. The instructions changes while algorithm stays intact. The purpose is to evade signature based detections without manually change the shellcode.
We won&amp;rsquo;t be creating our own polymorphic engine in this article, instead we will manually modify these three shellcodes from shell-storm.org:
Linux/x86 - shutdown -h now Shellcode - 56 bytes Linux/x86 - 40 byte shellcode to flush ipchains for Linux x86 Linux/x86 - Download + chmod + exec - 108 bytes We are not allowed to increase the size more than 50%.</description></item><item><title>SLAE 5: Analyzing shellcode generated by msfvenom</title><link>https://dubell.io/slae-5-analyzing-shellcode-generated-by-msfvenom/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jan 2020 13:33:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dubell.io/slae-5-analyzing-shellcode-generated-by-msfvenom/</guid><description>In this article, I will analyse three shellcode samples generated by msfvenom, specifically:
linux/x86/read_file linux/x86/adduser linux/x86/shell/reverse_tcp msfvenom --list payloads -a x86 --platform linux Let&amp;rsquo;s see if there is something new we can learn from these samples :)
Analyzing linux/x86/read_file First, we generate the executable like so:
msfvenom -p linux/x86/read_file -a x86 --platform linux PATH=/etc/passwd FD=2 -f elf -o read_file I set the payload options PATH and FD to /etc/passwd and 2.</description></item><item><title>SLAE 4: Custom encoder for bypassing signature based detection</title><link>https://dubell.io/slae-4-custom-encoder-for-bypassing-signature-based-detection/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2020 13:33:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dubell.io/slae-4-custom-encoder-for-bypassing-signature-based-detection/</guid><description>Malware detection techniques has improved a lot over the years. Today companies are investing in machine learning methods for detecting malware, which sounds pretty cool if you ask me. However, there is one method that has been used since the first anti-virus software, which is signature based detection.
When disassembling a program you can analyze the assembly instructions in order to understand the program from the lowest level. It&amp;rsquo;s also possible from the assembly code to identify a set of unique instructions that identifies a specific program.</description></item><item><title>SLAE 3: Egg hunting in Linux x86 Assembly</title><link>https://dubell.io/slae-3-egg-hunting-in-linux-x86-assembly/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2020 13:33:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dubell.io/slae-3-egg-hunting-in-linux-x86-assembly/</guid><description>When writing exploits, you sometimes encounter a situation where your payload is too big, you can&amp;rsquo;t fit your payload inside the buffer. This is where &amp;ldquo;eggs&amp;rdquo; come in to play. The basic idea of egg hunting is to divide the payload in to two parts, part one is the hunter while part two is the hunted (the egg). The hunter is a set of instructions that searches the program&amp;rsquo;s virtual address space for a given pattern (the egg).</description></item><item><title>SLAE 2: Creating a reverse TCP shell in x86 Assembly</title><link>https://dubell.io/slae-2-creating-a-reverse-tcp-shell-in-x86-assembly/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jan 2020 13:33:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dubell.io/slae-2-creating-a-reverse-tcp-shell-in-x86-assembly/</guid><description>What is a reverse TCP shell?
A reverse TCP shell is a program that instead of listening for incoming connections, the program will connect to a remote system and provide a local shell. This is useful in situations where the victim system is behind NAT, meaning you can&amp;rsquo;t directly connect to it, instead the server will connect to you. For this reason, reverse TCP shells are usually prefered over bind shells.</description></item><item><title>SLAE 1: Creating a bind shell in x86 Assembly</title><link>https://dubell.io/slae-1-creating-a-bind-shell-in-x86-assembly/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jan 2020 13:33:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dubell.io/slae-1-creating-a-bind-shell-in-x86-assembly/</guid><description>What is a bind shell?
A Bind shell is simply a program that listens for incoming connections. When a connection is made, a local shell is redirected to the newly created connection, thereby giving access to the local machine. Bind shells are usually created for backdoor access, although they could also be used for legitimate purposes, e.g. system administration.
