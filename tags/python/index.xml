I was surprised when I found a few patterns that I hadn&amp;rsquo;t really thought about, most likely because I never write Python code like the examples I found. Nevertheless, I learned something new and thought I share it here.
Example One Passing an untrusted string to an f-string while passing a dict as an argument to the logger, may give the attacker the possibility to read keys in the dict that should not be readable.</description></item><item><title>Technical Analysis Of The Necr0 Python Malware</title><link>https://dubell.io/www/2020/04/technical-analysis-of-the-necr0-python-malware/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Apr 2020 13:13:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dubell.io/www/2020/04/technical-analysis-of-the-necr0-python-malware/</guid><description>I recently got a hold of a malware sample written in python that dropped crypto currency miners, among other things. It was built with Python2.7 and was heavily obfuscated. I decided to analyse it and try to break it apart to understand it better and its capabilities.
In this article, I will show some parts of the malware and explain its purpose. I will also provide some detection techniques for detecting this specific malware.</description></item></channel></rss>
