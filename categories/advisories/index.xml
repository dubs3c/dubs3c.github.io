MobilePASS is a Two-factor authentication solution, which can run on Windows.
When MobilePASS is executed, it attempts to load etoken.dll from several locations, including the user&amp;rsquo;s desktop folder and the %APPDATA% directory.
This enables an attacker with local access to place a malicious etoken.dll in the directory where MobilePASS attempts to load it. As a result, the attacker can disguise their activity behind MobilePASS.</description></item><item><title>Server-Side Request Forgery in HikCentral Professional &lt;= V2.5.1</title><link>https://dubell.io/server-side-request-forgery-in-hikcentral-professional-v2.5.1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 May 2024 23:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://dubell.io/server-side-request-forgery-in-hikcentral-professional-v2.5.1/</guid><description>During an engagement, I encountered HikCentral Professional. I did not find any relevant CVEs and therefore decided to download the software and perform a quick analysis. Upon examining the related configuration files, I immediately identified a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in the NGINX configuration file. The SSRF allowed an attacker to proxy requests via HikCentral Professional, which could lead to severe consequences. For example, an attacker could use the vulnerability to reach into a private network and access internal services.</description></item><item><title>Unauthenticated LFI in Appwrite 0.5.0 &lt;= 0.12.1</title><link>https://dubell.io/unauthenticated-lfi-in-appwrite-0.5.0-0.12.1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Feb 2022 13:13:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dubell.io/unauthenticated-lfi-in-appwrite-0.5.0-0.12.1/</guid><description>While exploring cyber space I stumbled upon a project called Appwrite. Looked interesting, started browsing the code. Eventually, I discovered an undisclosed vulnerability in one of the endpoints allowing an attacker to read local files on the system.
The endpoint /.well-known/acme-challenge is vulnerable against local file inclusion which allows an attacker to read arbitrary files on the system. The endpoint contains incorrect checks for verifying that file is located within a defined base path.</description></item></channel></rss>
