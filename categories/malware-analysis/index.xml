It was built with Python2.7 and was heavily obfuscated. I decided to analyse it and try to break it apart to understand it better and its capabilities.
In this article, I will show some parts of the malware and explain its purpose. I will also provide some detection techniques for detecting this specific malware.</description></item></channel></rss>
