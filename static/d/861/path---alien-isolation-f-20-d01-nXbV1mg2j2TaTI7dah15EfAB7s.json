A few \"holy shit\" here and there but nothing too scary. One thing I noticed in the beginning was these weird noises which sounded like they were coming from the ventilation shafts.

As I made my way to the exit I could hear violent stomps behind me, and as I turned around there was this scary beast about devour my face. <code class=\"language-text\">Hooooly shiit</code></p>\n<p>I think the only way to play this game successfully is to go into stealth mode. Basically hide in the dark and do not let anyone know you are there, as soon as there is gunfire the Alien will come and kill everyone. Never run unless you are sure you are going to make it...</p>\n<p>It took my girlfriend and I 20 hours to complete the game, which I thought was very long for a non open-world game.
